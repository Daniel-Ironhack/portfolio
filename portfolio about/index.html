            <h4> Rio de Janeiro, Brazil &#8212 Florida, US</h4>
            <p> My name is Thiago and I earned my degree in Foreign Trade in **April of ****, after a not-so-brief stint in Israel and in the US. The choice was made largely for practical reasons and business opportunities and, while it brought me professional fullfilment, it wasn't something I aspired to do.<br> In the last few years I worked as a **** in a real estate development company.

            <p class="coding">As for my interest in coding, it started at an early age, motivated by my interest in classic (old?) 8 and 16 bit video-games. Street Fighter 2 and Megaman were all-time favorites of mine, but unfortunately the interest never went past that.

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2> 
          
            <p> As most Brazilians I've been known to skip celebrations, family reunions and dates because of football matches, and I practice BJJ whenever possible. On the other hand I don't applaud the sunset, dance Samba or mug people. So I'm not the full-blown stereotype. Yet. <br> And since old habits really die hard, I still play a game or two every blue moon.
